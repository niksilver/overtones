# Overtone experiment in Pure Data

A patch to play a tone with overtones.
Sliders allow us to vary:
* The amplitude of the overtones. Higher overtones will
  be quieter, but the degree to which this happens can change.
* Damp/Enhance alternate overtones. We can adjust it so that
  even overtones are slightly louder and odd ones are slightly
  quieter, or vice versa.
